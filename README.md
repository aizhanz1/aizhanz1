## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Writing requirements

-[Technical Writing Functional Documentation](https://github.com/aizhanz1/software-writing-aizhan/wiki/Functional-Documentation)


### Python Notebooks

**Python Notebook:** [EDA of Air Quality dataset by WHO (2010-2021)](https://github.com/aizhanz1/aizhanz1/blob/main/python%20notebooks/Data_Analysis_for%20_portfolio.ipynb)  
**Description:** Demonstrates exploratory data analysis of air quality data across regions, countries worldwide, with interactive visualizations and insights.  
**Skills:** Python, pandas, data visualization, exploratory analysis.  
**Technology:** Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Python.  
**Results:** MENA (Eastern Mediterranean region) has the highest PM10 level. Strong positive correlation. Higher PM2.5 tends to be found with higher PM10. There is a statistically significant upward trend in PM2.5 over time (about 0.67 Î¼g/mÂ³ per year). However, year alone explains almost nothing about the changes in PM2.5 (RÂ² = 0.008). Other factors (location, region, policies, etc.) likely drive the real variation.

The model does NOT fit the data very wellâ€”itâ€™s only picking up a very weak overall time trend.
### Power BI projects

### Retail chain in the US Analytics
**Power BI file:** [`dashboard.pbix`](https://github.com/aizhanz1/aizhanz1/tree/main/Retail_Analysis_US)

## Certificates
