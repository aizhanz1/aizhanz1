## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Writing requirements

## [📂 Technical writing](https://github.com/aizhanz1/software-writing-aizhan/tree/main)
Explore the complete repository for additional samples, including API specs, user guides, and release documentation.

### [1. Fintech Documentation Demo](https://github.com/aizhanz1/software-writing-aizhan/wiki/Fintech-Documentation-Demo)

Highlights clarity in documenting workflows and aligning technical details with stakeholder needs.

### 3. Process Map: [Requirement Gathering SOP – PDF](https://github.com/aizhanz1/software-writing-aizhan/blob/main/SOP%20Requirement%20Gathering.pdf)



### Python Notebooks

**Python Notebook:** [EDA of Air Quality dataset by WHO (2010-2021)](https://github.com/aizhanz1/aizhanz1/blob/main/python%20notebooks/Data_Analysis_for%20_portfolio.ipynb)  
**Description:** Demonstrates exploratory data analysis of air quality data across regions, countries worldwide, with interactive visualizations and insights.  
**Skills:** Python, pandas, data visualization, exploratory analysis.  
**Technology:** Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Python.  
**Results:** MENA (Eastern Mediterranean region) has the highest PM10 level. Strong positive correlation. Higher PM2.5 tends to be found with higher PM10. There is a statistically significant upward trend in PM2.5 over time (about 0.67 μg/m³ per year). However, year alone explains almost nothing about the changes in PM2.5 (R² = 0.008). Other factors (location, region, policies, etc.) likely drive the real variation.
